# EDA_Healthcare
The Healthcare dataset has 55,500 entries and 15 columns, including patient demographics, medical conditions, billing details, and test results. 

## Key columns include:

Age, Gender, Blood Type
Medical Condition, Medication, Test Results
Billing Amount, Admission Type, Hospital
Admission and Discharge Dates

## Create .ipynb file
The first step of EDA project is to create a .ipynb file in any python environment you like.

## Next, I've performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), including:

1. Checking for missing values
2. Descriptive statistics
3. Visualizing distributions and trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn


## Let's start by checking for missing values. ​​

You can run the following code in your own Python environment to check for missing values:

### Check for missing values
// missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
// missing_values[missing_values > 0]
